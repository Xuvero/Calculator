<p>Quick Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The "%" is not percent button it acts as mod (modulo operator), and returns the remainder of the division between the two numbers,
    i was going to change this, but i think this is a cool feature for the project plus i never see this in another calculators.
  </li>
  <li>If you write something the calculator can't understand it will show a mensage saying "Incorrect Expression."</li>
  <li>You can click with the mouse in the entry and write the calculation as it is in any calculator...</li>
  <li>The calculator can do operation with float numbers and show the results as float numbers too.</li>
